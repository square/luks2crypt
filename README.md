Luks2Crypt
==========

- https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/

- https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/blob/v2.2.2/lib/libcryptsetup.h

Luks2crypt is used to manage luks client devices and allow escrowing to a
[crypt-server](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt-Server). Currently, it
implements some functionality similar to [Crypt2](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/crypt2).

`postimaging`:

- gathers system info (serial number, username, hostname)

- generates a random password

- test if the password passed in on the cli unlocks the disk

- caches the new password to `/etc/luks2crypt/crypt_recovery_key.json`

- uploads the new password to your local crypt-server

- changes the luks password passed in on the cli to the newly generated one

Dependencies
------------

Luks2crypt requires a pre-existing crypt-server to escrow keys. Crypt-server is
a Django web service for centrally storing recovery keys for full disk
encryption. See: https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt-Server for more details.

Usage
-----

Setting the admin password and escrowing it post imaging:

    sudo luks2crypt postimaging \
      --luksdevice "<device_to_manage>" \
      --currentpassword "<password_to_replace>" \
      --cryptserver "<cryptserver.example.com>"

If your Crypt server uses basic authentication to protect the checkin endpoint:

    sudo luks2crypt postimaging \
      --luksdevice "<device_to_manage>" \
      --currentpassword "<password_to_replace>" \
      --cryptserver "<cryptserver.example.com>" \
      --authuser "<basic auth username>" \
      --authpass "<basic auth password>"

If you omit the password, luk2crypt will prompt for one.

Development
-----------

- This repository uses go modules (https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
You should be able to simply `go get` the repo and the dependencies will
auto install. You will need to be using go version 1.11 or higher.

- The cryptsetup libs are required to build. Cryptsetup C libraries are used
through cgo to manage the encrypted devices. On debian/ubuntu you can run:

      sudo apt install libcryptsetup-dev

- To prepare for a release by cleaning up the unused dependencies run:

      make deps

- Use the `Makefile` to test and build luks2crypt:

      make

- If you would like to use a mock crypt server to test client changes on is
  included in this project:

      make mockserver

- If you need a test environment, the provided `Vagrantfile` creates an ubuntu
  vm. The vagrantfile has a provision script that creates a luks disk image at
  `/home/vagrant/luks-dev-disk.img`. The image is then encrypted with the password
  "devpassword" and mounted at `/mnt`.

      make devup       # create the dev vm
      make devssh      # connect to the consule of the vm
      make devclean    # delete the vm

  This also includes a mock implimentation of crypt-server to log the form
  data to stdout. You can launch the dev environment as follows:

      make devup
      make devssh
      sudo cryptservermock  # start the mock crypt-server
      
      # in a new term window test the client
      make devssh
      sudo /vagrant/bin/luks2crypt postimaging \
        -l ./luks-dev-disk.img \
        -p devpassword \
        -s ubuntu-focal:8443

  You should then see the form post data printed to stdout from
  `cryptservermock`.
